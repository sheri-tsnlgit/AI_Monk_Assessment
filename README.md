Problem Statement : - 

Build an Object Detection Model which takes an image as input and returns the predictions of the detections and print the image with Bounding Boxes over the images and also return the detections in JSON format

Solution Proposed: - 

Build a Frontend and Back end application to execute the project. For Frontend i have used Flask API and for Back end i have used Python. A HTML file also developed for UI interaction of the Application. 

Algorithm used for object detection is the YOLOv8 model, which is the most recent stable model developed on COCO data sets. 

Approach to the solution is arrived at by doing little research on different versions of the YOLO models and ease of use from models.

Execution steps to replicate the results: -  

Approach -1 : - Using the zip file provided in the mail 

Step : 1. Download the zip file and unzip it 
Step : 2. Open the folder in VSCode
Step : 3. Open the terminal in VSCode and point to the current folder using cd command
Example: cd YOLO_AI_MONK
Step : 3 Creat a new virtual environment with python 3.9 or grater 
	The code worked well with Python 3.9.6
	Run the following command in terminal to create a new venv 
	python3 -m venv yolo_exp
	Yolo_exp is the new venv created 
Step : 4. Activate the new venv with following command in terminal
source yolo_exp/bin/activate 
This will activate the new environment 
Step : 5. Install the requirements using requirements.txt file, the file has all the dependencies need for running the current application

	pip install -r requirements.txt
Step : 6. Once the requirements.txt is completed then run the following code to test the application locally 

python yolo_detection.py

This open the application on your default browser chrome or safari 
Step : 7. Open your default browser and run the following url in the browser

http://localhost:8080/
You will be able to see a HTML file where you can upload the image and see the results like image with detection showing in the image and below the detection image you can see the predictions with labels and bounding box coordinates

Sample results are shown in the result section of the documents

Approach 2: cloning the source code from git repository 

Create a new folder and cd to your new folder using VS code terminal 

Run the following command in your VScode terminal 

 Run :  git clone https://github.com/sheri-tsnlgit/AI_Monk_Assessment.git

Once the code is cloned to your folder then follow the same steps as mentioned in approach 1

Step : 2. Open the folder in VSCode
Step : 3. Open the terminal in VSCode and point to the current folder using cd command
Example: cd YOLO_AI_MONK
Step : 3 Creat a new virtual environment with python 3.9 or grater 
	The code worked well with Python 3.9.6
	Run the following command in terminal to create a new venv 
	python3 -m venv yolo_exp
	Yolo_exp is the new venv created 
Step : 4. Activate the new venv with following command in terminal
source yolo_exp/bin/activate 
This will activate the new environment 
Step : 5. Install the requirements using requirements.txt file, the file has all the dependencies need for running the current application

	pip install -r requirements.txt
Step : 6. Once the requirements.txt is completed then run the following code to test the application locally 

python yolo_detection.py

This open the application on your default browser chrome or safari 
Step : 7. Open your default browser and run the following url in the browser

http://localhost:8080/
You will be able to see a HTML file where you can upload the image and see the results like image with detection showing in the image and below the detection image you can see the predictions with labels and bounding box coordinates

Sample results are shown in the result section of the documents


 Approach 3: - If docker is installed in your laptop

 Once the source code is downloaded or unzipped in your pc 

 cd YOLO_AI_MONK

Build a docker image using the docker file provided in the code 

Build Docker image with following code by running it in your VScode terminal

docker build -t <docker-username>/yolo_exp:v01 .

This takes time to build the docker image. Once built, run the docker container to see the results. Run the following code to see the flask application running on you default browser on  http://localhost:8080/

docker run -p 8080:8080 <docker-username>yolo_exp:v01 

Yolo_exp is my image name, you can have your own docker image name of your choice 

Sample results can be seen in the results section of the folder
